# Vila de Vie Hotel Website

This project focuses on the front-end of a hotel website. Our team wants to create a simple, easy-to-use booking website for people of all ages. This is the first time we've applied HTML, CSS, JavaScript into a project so there will be some things we need to fix and work on more. Hope you find this project worth it!

## Motivation
We have a chance to dive into the front-end development at our university. We want to use our knowledge in a practical project and gain more experience from it. Vila de Via, a hotel booking website, is the subject that our team's all interested in.
